ðŸ§  Custom UART Controller in Verilog (RTL and Verification)

ðŸš€ This project implements a fully custom UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) Controller using Verilog HDL, designed for high-speed, full-duplex serial communication with a focus on hardware and memory efficiency. It supports baud rates up to 921600 with a 100â€¯MHz core clock, maintaining a communication error margin within Â±2%.

ðŸ”‘ Key Implementation Details
ðŸ§± Modular Architecture
Consists of three main blocks:

Baud Generator: Generates local clocks based on user-specified baud rate and core clock frequency, with 16x oversampling support for precise receiver synchronization.

Transmitter: Utilizes a PISO shift register and transmits 8-bit data with an odd parity bit, controlled by a clean FSM: IDLE â†’ START â†’ DATA_OUT â†’ PARITY â†’ STOP â†’ RESET.

Receiver: Implements a SIPO shift register, performs parity and frame validation, and uses its own FSM: IDLE â†’ DATA_START â†’ DATA_IN â†’ DATA_PARITY â†’ DATA_STOP.

ðŸ“¶ High-Speed Communication
Operates at baud rates up to 921600, suitable for demanding serial interfaces.

ðŸ’¾ Memory-Efficient Design
Built using compact FSM logic and shift registers to minimize hardware and memory usage.

ðŸ”‹ Low Power Operation
Selective enable signals for each module (transmitter, receiver, baud generator) reduce unnecessary switching when idle.

âœ… Error-Tolerant Protocol
Includes start, parity, and stop bit checks to ensure only valid and verified data is received and forwarded.

ðŸ”„ Full Duplex Communication
Supports simultaneous 8-bit transmission and reception through independent paths.
