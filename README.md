# ðŸ§  Custom UART Controller in Verilog (RTL and Verification)

ðŸš€ This project implements a fully custom **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) Controller** using **Verilog HDL**, designed for high-speed, full-duplex serial communication with a focus on **hardware and memory efficiency**. It supports baud rates up to **921600** with a **100â€¯MHz core clock**, maintaining a communication error margin within **Â±2%**.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Implementation Details

### ðŸ§± Modular Architecture

Consists of three main blocks:

- ðŸ”§ **Baud Generator**  
  Generates local clocks based on user-specified baud rate and core clock frequency, with **16Ã— oversampling** support for precise receiver synchronization.

- ðŸ“¤ **Transmitter**  
  Utilizes an **8-bit PISO shift register**, transmits 8-bit data with an **odd parity bit**, and is driven by a clean FSM:  
  `IDLE â†’ START â†’ DATA_OUT â†’ PARITY â†’ STOP â†’ RESET`.

- ðŸ“¥ **Receiver**  
  Implements an **8-bit SIPO shift register**, performs **parity and frame validation**, and is managed by its own FSM:  
  `IDLE â†’ DATA_START â†’ DATA_IN â†’ DATA_PARITY â†’ DATA_STOP`.

### ðŸ“¶ High-Speed Communication

- Operates at baud rates up to **921600** with a **100â€¯MHz clock**, ideal for high-performance serial interfaces.

---

### ðŸ’¾ Memory-Efficient Design

- Built using **compact FSM logic** and **minimal shift register hardware**, ensuring low resource utilization.

---

### ðŸ”‹ Low Power Operation

- Employs **selective enable signals** for the main module, transmitter, and receiver, minimizing switching activity and power consumption when idle.

---

### âœ… Error-Tolerant Protocol

- Implements **start, parity, and stop bit** checks to ensure that only correctly framed and verified data is accepted and forwarded.

---

### ðŸ”„ Full Duplex Communication

- Supports simultaneous **8-bit data transmission and reception** through completely independent and parallel transmitter and receiver paths.
